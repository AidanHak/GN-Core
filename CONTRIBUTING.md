### Commit Rules

Generally try to follow the following format:
 
 - Each minor change should have its own commit attached to it for easy rollback
 - Commit messages should be informative

Our danger file has a few commit rules that will get Cuny-Bot to yell at you. Don't worry if he does, he gets upset by accedent sometimes. 

The current commit rules are:

- Start all commit messages with a Capital (Failure to do so results in a CUNY-Bot warning you, not a big deal if you slip up!)
- Keep commits messages short
