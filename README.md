# Welcome! 👋

## What is Grade Notifier?

Great question! Let me highlight a few of our strengths:

|   |Features |
|---|---|
|🚨| Get Notifier when a new grade is posted |
|<img src=./Assets/CUNY-Logo.png width=30>| Available to all CUNY schools |
|📧| Works with email |
|📱| Works with Phone |
|⏳| Save Time|
|😰| Reduce Stress|
|👨‍👩‍👧‍👦| Open Source|

We aim to allow students to enjoy their vacation instead of checking every minute to see if theor grades were released. We check every 5 minutes for you and notifiy you in case of a grade change.

## FAQ

**Q: Do you store passwords?**<br>
A: No way! You password is never stored on our server and we never get a chance to see it. 

**Q: Do you store usernames?**<br>
A: Yes we do. In order to restrict users from signing in multiple times we keep track of which usernames are actively using the service. If you have any questions about that please contact me @ ehud.adler62@qmail.cuny.edu

**Q: Do you store any other information?**<br>
A: We retain the right to store any non-user specific data. For example, we will *NEVER* look at your you and your grades but we may capture that some person got a A+ in a certain class. Again, your name will never be associated with that grade and we will have no way of knowing where that grade came from. If you have any questions about that please contact me @ ehud.adler62@qmail.cuny.edu

**Q: I signed up but didn't get an initial text**<br>
A: Wait a few more minutes sometimes the system are overloaded and the message takes time to send. If you still haven't received a message after 10 minutes it could be there was an issue, just try signing up again. If it persists, reach out. We're happy to help.
